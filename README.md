## Digital-Calculator

# ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a simple yet powerful Scientific Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with advanced mathematical functions like trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), logarithm, square root, exponential (10^x), and power (x^y). The JavaScript logic is embedded directly into the HTML file, making it easy to manage without separate script files.

#  âš¡ Features
âœ… Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, Ã—, Ã·)  
âœ… Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) (works in degrees)  
âœ… Logarithm (log10 x)  
âœ… Square root (âˆšx)  
âœ… Exponential (EXP = 10^x)  
âœ… Power function (xÊ¸)   
âœ… Clean and modern UI with CSS styling  
âœ… Responsive design   


# ðŸŽ¯ How to Use
1. Click on the buttons to enter numbers and operations.
2. Use sin, cos, tan for trigonometric calculations (input in degrees).
3. Use log for logarithm (base 10).
4. Use âˆš for square root calculation.
5. Use EXP to calculate 10^x.
6. Use xÊ¸ to enter a base, then input an exponent when prompted.
7. Press = to evaluate the expression.
8. Press AC to clear the display.

# ðŸš€ Technologies Used
1. HTML (for structure)
2. CSS (for styling)
3. JavaScript (for functionality)
